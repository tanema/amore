## REDO
IDEAS FOR BETTER WORLD
- Make more portable with goxjs toolkit. Get games on web
- Simplify and get rid of extra items like particle generator that isn't needed
- scripting interface
- combine keyboard, joystick and touch into a single input, mapping package
- Somehow enable cross platform deploy easily

TODO:
- [x] minimize everything, this is for myself I don't need all this extra
- [x] remove sdl and use [goxjs glfw](https://github.com/goxjs/glfw)
- [x] reimlement input with mapping key to event
- [x] goxjs file loading glfw.Open()
- [ ] use [beep](https://github.com/faiface/beep) to have cross platform audio
- [x] use [goxjs](https://github.com/goxjs/gl) for better cross platform
- [ ] default antialiasing?
- [ ] fix font rendering/sprite batching in web runtime
- [x] use [glua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua) for scripting
- [ ] [cross compile](https://github.com/karalabe/xgo) on a singple platform

These changes will reduce functionality but make it more portable.
