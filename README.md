## REDO
IDEAS FOR BETTER WORLD
- Make more portable with goxjs toolkit. Get games on web
- Simplify and get rid of extra items like particle generator that isn't needed
- scripting interface
- combine keyboard, joystick and touch into a single input, mapping package
- Somehow enable cross platform deploy easily

TODO:
- [x] minimize everything, this is for myself I don't need all this extra
- [x] remove sdl and use https://github.com/goxjs/glfw
- [x] change out specific opengl for https://github.com/goxjs/gl
- [x] reimlement input with mapping key to event
- [x] goxjs file loading glfw.Open()
- [ ] fix default non fullscreen scaling
- [ ] fix web runtime
    - [ ] font rendering
- [ ] use glua for scripting https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua
- [ ] cross compile https://github.com/karalabe/xgo

These changes will reduce functionality but make it more portable.
